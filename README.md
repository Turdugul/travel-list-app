# React App Project

## Description

This project is a React application demonstrating the fundamental concepts of state management, component creation, and dynamic rendering. It includes the following features:

- **State Management with `useState`**: Illustrates how to manage and manipulate component state using React's `useState` hook.
- **Component Creation**: Covers the process of creating reusable components and structuring them for better maintainability.
- **Rendering Lists**: Shows how to dynamically render lists of items from state or props.
